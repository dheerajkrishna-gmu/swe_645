->Configure the network settings to allow SSH, HTTP, and HTTPS traffic from the internet.
->Choose the storage options for your instance.

Connecting to Your EC2 Instance:

->In the EC2 dashboard, select your instance and click the "Connect" button.

->Once connected, switch to the root user by typing:

Installing and running a Web Server:

->On your EC2 instance, run the following command to install the Apache web server:

"yum install httpd -y"
